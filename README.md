# VeritasScan 🛡️

VeritasScan is a mobile-friendly web application that helps users assess the credibility of messages and news content commonly shared on messaging platforms and social media. It provides an AI-assisted analysis to identify potential misinformation and explains the reasoning behind each assessment.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Misinformation spreads rapidly through WhatsApp forwards, viral posts, and informal news sources. Many users lack quick and accessible tools to verify content, leading to confusion, panic, and the spread of false information.

---

## 💡 Solution

VeritasScan allows users to paste any message or news text and instantly receive:
- A credibility assessment
- A clear explanation of why the content may be misleading

Instead of simply labeling content as “fake” or “real,” VeritasScan highlights indicators such as emotional exaggeration, sensational claims, persuasive manipulation, and lack of credible sources. This encourages informed decision-making and critical thinking.
